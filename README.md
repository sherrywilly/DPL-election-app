## 1. Introduction
The DPL Election Application is a robust web platform built to streamline and manage election procedures. It provides functionalities for handling user accounts, managing election data, and ensuring a smooth voting experience. The project leverages Django for its backend, and Docker for containerization, making it highly portable and easy to deploy across different environments.




## 2. Features
- **User Accounts**: Manages user registration, login, and profiles.
- **Election Management**: Core functionalities for setting up and running elections.
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose for easy setup and deployment.
- **Database Integration**: Likely uses a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL with `psycopg2` as indicated in `requirements.txt`).
- **Web Interface**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly experience.




## 3. Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python, Django
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via `psycopg2`)
- **Dependencies**: asgiref, defusedxml, diff-match-patch, Django, django-import-export, django-versatileimagefield, et-xmlfile, libmagic, MarkupPy, odfpy, openpyxl, Pillow, python-magic, pytz, PyYAML, six, sqlparse, tablib, xlrd, xlwt (as per `requirements.txt`)




## 4. Installation and Setup
This project uses Docker and Docker Compose for easy setup and deployment. Follow these steps to get the application running:

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Steps
1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sherrywilly/DPL-election-app.git
    cd DPL-election-app
    ```

2.  **Build and run the Docker containers**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will build the Docker images (if not already built) and start the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

3.  **Run database migrations**:
    Once the containers are up, you need to run Django migrations to set up the database schema. You can execute commands inside the running Django container:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
    ```

4.  **Create a superuser** (optional, for admin access):
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create an administrator account.

5.  **Access the application**:
    The application should now be accessible in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:8000/` (or the port specified in your `docker-compose.yml`).

### Additional Scripts
- `connect.sh`: This script might be used to connect to a specific service or container within the Docker environment.
- `entry.sh`: This script is likely the entrypoint for the Docker container, executing commands when the container starts.




## 5. Usage
After successfully setting up and running the application using Docker Compose, you can access it via your web browser. The primary functionalities include:

-   **User Registration and Login**: Create new user accounts or log in with existing credentials.
-   **Election Participation**: Users can view available elections and cast their votes.
-   **Admin Panel**: Superusers can access the Django admin panel to manage users, elections, candidates, and other data.

Specific usage instructions will depend on the implemented features within the `accounts` and `election` Django apps.
